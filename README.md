# ADR Docs

A repository of Architectural Decision Records, ADR, for CU Central Advancement.

ADRs are great tools for development teams to catalog past decisions and draw upon that catalog for future work. Far too often, 
a decision is made in isolation and while the solution exists new developers often ask the "why?" of the codebase and not the "what?"
of the codebase they can already see.

For example, if you are working on migrating a legacy application to a new tech stack, you might go through several iterations of
design making sure to document the final version. However, if you delete the repository, issues, and comments about the past
iterations, you lose a lot of the "why?" context, and you can waste a lot of time being a new employee doomed to repeat past failed ideas.

For these reasons, CU Central Advancment will document all future significant architectural decisions in the ADR format.

## Background

The idea for creating this repo came from the 2021 BYU UAPI conference with particular advice from the great Brent Moore.

This is obviously a work in progress, but here are some links for background orientation:

- ADR main GitHub repo and readme with links - https://adr.github.io/
- C4 model of writing context diagrams - https://c4model.com/
- Docz project used to render these ADRs - https://www.docz.site/docs/introduction
- Easy diagram tool to use with C4 shapes - https://app.diagrams.net/
