# Use `asdf` For Dyno-related Dependency Management

When working on several development projects, language versioning can be an issue
when one project has dependencies that prevent upgrading the language version. For
MacOS users, typically this means using `homebrew` and linking/unlinking kegs.

While looking for the best way to manage language versions for local development, 
I found the `asdf` utility which has support for all the languages the Digital 
Engagement team currently uses. It claims to make the process way easier, and I have
been using it.
