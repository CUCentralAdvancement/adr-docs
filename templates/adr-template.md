# ADR template by Michael Nygard

This is the template in 
[Documenting architecture decisions - Michael Nygard](http://thinkrelevance.com/blog/2011/11/15/documenting-architecture-decisions)
. You can use [adr-tools](https://github.com/npryce/adr-tools) for managing the ADR files.

In each ADR file, write these sections:

# Title

## Sponsors

While someone could look at the Git history to get a good idea of authorship, it is better to list
sponsors at the top to orient the readers and let them know who to contact for proposal changes or
suggestions.

## Status

What is the status, such as proposed, accepted, rejected, deprecated, superseded, etc.? List all
past and current ADRs that this proposal relates to.

## Prior Art

No ideas come out of thin air anymore. Please list other sources where you are drawing your ideas
from. Often times, these texts can be used to explain the decision context in more detail so that
the ADRs can remain succinct.

## Current Context

What is the issue that we're seeing that is motivating this decision or change?

## Decision

What is the change that we're proposing and/or doing?

## Consequences

What becomes easier or more difficult to do because of this change?

## Detailed Explanation

If you have more words that don't fit above or in some kind of related documentation, you should put
them here. An example: a presentation/meeting notes that were crucial in making a decision.
